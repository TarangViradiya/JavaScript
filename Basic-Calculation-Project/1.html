        //1.Imagine you are developing a simple shopping cart application. You have a product with a price of $25. The application should calculate the total cost of the product based on the quantity entered by the user.  Price (the price of the product) and quantity (the quantity of the product the user wants to buy). Formula totalCost = price * quantity.

        // let price = 25
        // let quantity = prompt("Enter the quantity : ")

        // let a = price * quantity 

        // console.log("total: $",a)

        // 2.Write a JavaScript program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight in kilograms and height in meters. The program should prompt the user to input their weight and height, and then calculate and display the BMI using the formula:

        // let w = prompt("Enter your weight :  ")
        // let h = prompt("Enter your height : ")

        // let formula = w / ( h * h )

        // console.log("Your BMI is : ",formula)

        // 3.Speed and Time Calculation
        // Write a JavaScript program that calculates the speed of an object based on the distance travelled and the time taken. The program should prompt the user to input the distance travelled (in meters) and the time taken (in seconds), and then calculate and display the speed in meters per second (m/s).

        // let m = prompt("Enter the distance travelled in meters: ")
        // let s = prompt("Enter the time taken in seconds: ")

        // let formula= (m/s)

        // console.log("The speed is ",formula)
